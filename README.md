MLH for HackEmory V


## INSPIRATION
Wanted to make something socially fun for parties.

## WHAT IT DOES
Users can search for songs from YouTube, then our app rips the vocals and displays lyrics to the songs. Other functionalities are: collect songs in a queue, play songs, pause songs, remove songs from queue.

## HOW I BUILT IT
With 24 hours to build our product, the best way to organize our actions in a sort of design sprint for 2 teams. It was something like:

Design // Development teams
1. Map out overall design // List core functionalities
2. Sketch how frontend should look // Research possible APIs
3. Craft clickable prototype in inVision // Create sandbox environments to test API
4. Build the frontend // Test the APIs
5. Consolidate everything together

## CHALLENGES I RAN INTO
Team members had a great passion for my Karaoke pitch, I had to limit the team down to 8 people (rather than 12). Since I had a developer background, I was the bridge to checking in on everyone to make sure they're on the same page.


## ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT I'M PROUD OF
This was the first hackathon I participated in with the most roles:
* Sprint Facilitator / Scrum Master
* UX Designer
* Frontend developer
